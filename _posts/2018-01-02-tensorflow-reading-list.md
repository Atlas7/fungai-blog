Learning Python and Deep Learning is one thing. Mastering Tensorflow is another. Here is my own curated list of useful Tensorflow related resources. I'll update this list on a regular basis.

### Websites / Courses

- [Tensorflow.org](https://www.tensorflow.org/): handy reference
- [CS 20SI: Tensorflow for Deep Learning Research](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs20si/syllabus.html): my personal favorite. First go-to point for beginner and experts alike.
- [Danijar Hafner Blog](https://danijar.com/): contains practical tips and advice on explaining Tensorflow concepts and structuring Tensorflow projects with great examples.
- [Johnny Chan's Twitter](https://twitter.com/jAtlas7): I use my Twitter timeline to bookmark resources on Tensorflow, Deep Learning, and all things software development.

### Useful Articles

- [What is a TensorFlow Graph and Session](https://danijar.com/what-is-a-tensorflow-session/): with an excellent codices example.
