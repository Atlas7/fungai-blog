#### Tell us about your background.

Professionally I had worked as a technologist for a large global investment bank, an analytics consultant for a major UK bank, and a full-stack developer for a wellness startup. In my spare time I am the creator and author of [Mathalope.co.uk](http://mathalope.co.uk/) (a tech blog visited by 120,000+ students and professionals from 180+ countries), voluntary developer of the [Friends of Russia Dock Woodland Website](http://fordw.org/), open source software contributor (including Tensorflow), hackathon competitor, and part of the Intel Software Innovator Program. My current goal is to become a full-time machine learning engineer.

#### What got you started in technology?

Whilst I was studying for my aeronautical engineering masters at Imperial College London, I learnt to write small Fortran/Matlab programs where you can throw at it say satellite data, and it spits out your geographical location on Earth. I then started my professional career in technology in 2008 for a global investment bank, where I collaborated with colleagues from all 4 regions globally (EMEA, ASPAC, NAM and LATAM), developed and rolled-out a fully automated data extraction and analytics tool - that helped protecting the 100,000+ production systems (Windows, UNIX, AIX, Mainframe platforms etc) in the bank from risk of overloading. I built the system with proprietary technologies such as SAS, SQL, Oracle, Autosys batch scheuling, and internal configuration databases. In 2014 I decided to learn about open source technologies in my spare time and as a result created [Mathalope.co.uk](http://mathalope.co.uk/) - and that's the point I believe is where I started making a real impact globally - contributing codes and knowledge to the rest of the world, reaching to audiences outside my comfort zone within a corporate environment.

#### What projects are you working on now?

I am currently building [fungAI.org](http://fungai.org/) - a machine learning application that automatically identify wild mushroom species from input images using deep learning (classification and localization) techniques, primarily motivated by a casual friend's Facebook post from a walking trip:
 
 > "hey do you know what mushroom this is?"
  
Coincidently [Clare my partner](https://twitter.com/lemon_disco) happens to be a mushroom enthusiast and so naturally we've formed a [couple team](http://127.0.0.1:4000/team/) - me focus on the tech part and Clare the domain expert! We think the project would be fun.

You can [read more about the project concept here](http://fungai.org/concept/), take a look at an [initial frontend toy demo here](https://fungai-react-ui.herokuapp.com/fungpredict), and check out this [Intel DevMesh Fungi Barbarian Project page](https://devmesh.intel.com/projects/fungi-barbarian).
