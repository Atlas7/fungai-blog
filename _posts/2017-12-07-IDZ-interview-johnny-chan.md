#### Tell us about your background.

Professionally I had worked as a technologist for a large global investment bank, an analytics consultant for a major UK bank, and a full-stack developer for a wellness startup. In my spare time I am the creator and author of [Mathalope.co.uk](http://mathalope.co.uk/) (a tech blog visited by 120,000+ students and professionals from 180+ countries), voluntary developer of the [Friends of Russia Dock Woodland Website](http://fordw.org/), open source software contributor (including Tensorflow), hackathon competitor, and part of the Intel Software Innovator Program. My current goal is to become a full-time machine learning engineer.

#### What got you started in technology?

Whilst I was studying for my aeronautical engineering masters at Imperial College London, I learnt to write small Fortran/Matlab programs where you can throw at it say satellite data, and it spits out your geographical location on Earth. I then started my professional career in technology in 2008 for a global investment bank, where I collaborated with colleagues from all 4 regions globally (EMEA, ASPAC, NAM and LATAM), developed and rolled-out a fully automated data extraction and analytics tool - that helped protecting the 100,000+ production systems (Windows, UNIX, AIX, Mainframe platforms etc) in the bank from risk of overloading. I built the system with proprietary technologies such as SAS, SQL, Oracle, Autosys batch scheuling, and internal configuration databases. In 2014 I decided to learn about open source technologies in my spare time and as a result created [Mathalope.co.uk](http://mathalope.co.uk/) - and that's the point I believe is where I started making a real impact globally - contributing codes and knowledge to the rest of the world, reaching to audiences outside my comfort zone within a corporate environment.

#### What projects are you working on now?

I am currently building [fungAI.org](http://fungai.org/) - an application with the aim of assisting scientists and enthusiasts to easily identify wild mushroom species from images using deep learning technologies.

This project was motivated by a casual friend's Facebook post from a walking trip:
 
 > "hey do you know what mushroom this is?"
  
I've decided to build an application that will help identifying wild mushroom species from images with deep learning technologies. You can see an [initial toy demo here](https://fungai-react-ui.herokuapp.com/fungpredict), and read more about it from this [Intel DevMesh Fungi Barbarian Project page](https://devmesh.intel.com/projects/fungi-barbarian).
