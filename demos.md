## Demos

Here are some initial proof of concepts (POC).

### Intel Developer Mesh Project

- Done! Created <a href="https://devmesh.intel.com/projects/fungi-barbarian" target="_blank">this DevMesh Project - Fungi Barbarian</a>.
  Use this page and share project updates with rest of Intel Developer Zone community.

### Blog

- Done! It is [this website - fungai.org](http://fungai.org)

### Batch Fungi Classification User Interface (UI)

- <a href="https://fungai-react-ui.herokuapp.com/fungpredict" target="_blank">ReactJS UI built with ReactJS and
  hosted on Heroku</a>. May take a while to spin up
- <a href="https://fungai-json-server-heroku.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Fake API built with json-server and
  hosted Heroku:</a>. May take a while to spin up

### Tensorflow Models - Training

- (coming soon) build a simple tensorflow classification model to recognise 3 catetories: Fly Agaric,
  Common Stinkhorn, and Scarlet Elf-cup. Expecting to use transfer learning on Inception v3 model for this.
- (coming soon) build a better tensorflow classification model to recognise more categories. 
  
### Tensorflow Models - Serving

Once we have a pre-trained Tensorflow model (or versions of models), we may integrate it to a frontend application,
such as web, mobile, and even <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_target">Raspberry Pi</a> with
Intel <a href="https://developer.movidius.com/" target="_blank">Movidius Neural Compute Stick</a>.

- (coming soon) serve pre-trained Tensorflow model to a web app
- (coming soon) serve pre-trained Tensorflow model to a mobile app (iOS, Android)
- (coming soon) serve pre-trained Tensorflow model to Raspberry Pi

Will update this page from time to time...
