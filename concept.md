## Concept overview

The proposed ecosystem looks like this:

- [Step 1: go on a wild mushroom survey trip](#step1)
- [Step 2: observe and take pictures](#step2)
- [Step 3: classification](#step3)
  - [option 1: with a Guide Book (immediately)](#step3a)
  - [option 2: with a machine learning app (offline, immediately)](#step3b)
  - [option 3: with a machine learning app (in a batch at home later)](#step3c)
- [Step 4: share what you learn with the world!](#step4)

## Concept in action

### <a name="step1">Step 1: Go on a Wild Mushroom Survey Trip</a>

1 - hmm where are you mushroom...

2 - Ah ha! Spotted a wild mushroom

### <a name="step2">Step 2: Observe and take pictures</a>

1 - What a beautify mushroom. OK obligatory pictures...

2 - Take more pictures...

### <a name="step3">Step 3: Classification</a>

#### <a name="step3a">Classification Option 1: with a Guide Book (immediately)</a>

Human: Hmmm... I think it is a (fill in the blanks)

#### <a name="step3b">Classification Option 2: with a machine learning app (offline, immediately)</a>

Computer says: hmmm... I think it is 99% likely that it is a (fill in the blanks).

#### <a name="step3c">Classification Option 3: with a machine learning app (in a batch at home later)</a>

This may be either online or offline.

1 - Go home, upload a batch of pictures to a computer
 
![trip-600.jpg](/images/blog/trip-600.jpg)

2 - computer says: these are the likely mushroom specie predictions

3 - computer says: you want to know more? Here are some more details. Click links to see other similar mushrooms of the same specie

### <a name="step4">Step 4 - Share what you learn with the world (optional)</a>

User may share what they've learn via:

- social media
- fungai.org
- etc.
